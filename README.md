# Randomized-Optimization Exploration

This repository contains the code for the Randomized Optimization algorithms implemented in Python. The algorithms implemented are:
1. Simulated Annealing
2. Genetic Algorithm
3. MIMIC

The algorithms are implemented in the `mlrose-hiive` package. The package is available at

We will compare & contrast the performance of these algorithms on the following common optimization problems:
1. Knapsack Problem
2. Four Peaks Problem
3. K-color Problem

The code is organized as follows:



How to run the code:
1. Clone the reposi
